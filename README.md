tired of detecting the package manager? use upm.
## what is upm??
upm detects your primary package manager and uses the proper command to do the action.  
for example, if you use arch (btw):  
you can ```sudo upm install neofetch```  
and it will run ```pacman -S neofetch```  
simple!  
no more trying the detect the package manager!!  

all commands are below:
### windows:
Usage: upm.ps1 <action> <package(s)>  
Actions:  
  install <package(s)>  - Install one or more package(s)  
  remove <package(s)>   - Remove one or more package(s)  
  update <package(s)>   - Update one or more specific package(s)  
  upgrade               - Upgrade all packages  
### linux and macos:
Usage: upm <action> <package(s)>  
Actions:  
  install <package(s)>  - Install one or more package(s)  
  remove <package(s)>   - Remove one or more package(s)  
  update <package(s)>   - Update one or more specific package(s)  
  upgrade               - Upgrade all packages  
## how do i install it?
### linux and macos:
```bash
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sctech-tr/upm/main/install.sh | sh
```
### windows:

@echo off
powershell -Command "(New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sctech-tr/upm/main/install.bat', 'install-upm.bat')"
